Hello, Vlaudia. 

Monika is writing a masters thesis, the subject of which is her art. Her media are poetry and weaving. 

The uploaded file is Monika's artistic statement for the thesis.

Her thesis advisor, Edris, made this comment:
"My suggestion would be to have one artistic statement with sections for different practices and then a statement of their integration as an interdisciplinary practice."

Would you please tell me What is the benefit of having separate artistic statements? Also, please give me your justification in detail for your response.

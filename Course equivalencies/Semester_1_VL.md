Certainly, I'd be happy to help you generate a set of course equivalencies for your first two semesters in the program. Based on the information you provided in the study plan, it seems like your interdisciplinary focus spans areas like mythopoetics, creative writing, art history, and textile arts. Let me put together a proposal for you.

Proposed Course Equivalencies - Semester 1:

1. ART 5100 Mythopoetic Narratives in Textile Arts (3 credits)
   - Exploration of mythopoetic themes, symbols, and archetypes as they manifest in global textile traditions. Examines how textiles can serve as vehicles for communal storytelling, spirituality, and modes of resistance. Studio component includes weaving, embroidery, and mixed-media textile projects inspired by mythopoetic concepts.

2. ENG 5200 Poetry, Contemplation, and the Poetics of Shelter (3 credits) 
   - In-depth study of the relationship between poetic expression, meditative practice, and the human need for physical, emotional, and spiritual shelter. Focuses on the work of poet-practitioners who have explored themes of refuge, withdrawal, and creative hermitage. Workshop component allows students to develop their own contemplative poetic practices.

3. ARH 5300 Textiles, Adornment, and Cultural Identity (3 credits)
   - Examines the role of textiles and modes of adornment in the construction and expression of cultural, religious, and personal identity across diverse global contexts. Includes case studies from Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe, with emphasis on textile-based ritual, performative, and folk art practices.

4. ART 5400 Materiality and the Metaphysics of Making (3 credits)
   - Interdisciplinary seminar exploring the philosophical, spiritual, and ecological dimensions of material engagement in art, craft, and design practices. Draws on readings from new materialism, phenomenology, and post-humanist theory to consider the animacy of matter and the transcendent potential of the creative process.

5. ART 5500 Collaborative Learning Opportunity: Experimental Practices (1.5 credits)
   - Participatory studio-based workshop series fostering cross-disciplinary exchange and collective exploration of experimental artistic methodologies. Includes group critiques, performative exercises, and collaborative projects.

6. ART 5600 Collaborative Learning Opportunity: Mycological Poetics (1.5 credits) 
   - Reading group and research seminar investigating the intersections between mycology, ecology, and creative praxis. Focuses on the work of Merlin Sheldrake and other thinkers who have considered the more-than-human networks that sustain life.

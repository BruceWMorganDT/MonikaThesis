Based on the detailed study plan, self-evaluation, and advisor evaluation provided in the document, we can generate course equivalencies that align with the interdisciplinary focus on mythopoetics, creative writing, art history, and textile art. Given the depth and breadth of Monika Neuland Thomas's work, these equivalencies will reflect an intensive engagement across these disciplines, supporting a rigorous and expansive approach to learning and creation.
